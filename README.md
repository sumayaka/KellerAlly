 Currency identification application for visually impaired using  Machine Learning and Voice Assistant.
In this Android project, speech to text conversion is used to convert the command 
issued by the visually impaired. Speech Recognition is a technology that allows people 
to enter information into systems using their voices. This android application uses 
text to speech concept to read the amount of the note to the users and thereafter turns 
the text value into voice. For the detection of the currency, the application uses Azure 
custom vision API using Machine learning classification technique to detect currency 
based on images or paper using smartphone camera. The application will be developed 
in Android Studio using Java programming languages. 
The main objective of the project is to create a user-friendly smartphone application 
for visually impaired or people with low eyesight that will aid them in identifying 
currency notes. Using our application Keller Ally, can help visually impaired and low
vision individuals become more independent.
